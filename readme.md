# Big-O Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

In this lab, you will be calculating Big O (worst case performance) of various sorting algorithms.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Calculate Big O for Insertion Sort **with an explanation**
- Calculate Big O for Merge Sort **with an explanation**
- Calculate Big O for Selection Sort **with an explanation**

Bonus:

- Calculate Big O for Quick Sort **with an explanation**


#### Starter code

In the `starter-code` folder, you will find code for the 4 algorithms.

#### Deliverable

Below each method, write the Big O analysis as well as an explanation for how you came to that conclusion.
